## How it works

1) Set up your bench market for an asset you want to sell at a fixed rate.
1) Select your desired purchase asset (or ALGO) and the price.
1) Optionally, timebox your bench by selecting the market start and end times


### Features

- Withdraw your proceeds at any time
- Supports ALGO and ASAs in both slots (selling/purchasing)
- Schedule bench markets to start in the future, or end at a specific time
  - If a bench has an end time set, you can mark it as "not cancellable", which will prevent manually closing the bench until the asset is fully sold
- Enforce purchase limits per account

### Fees

Bench platform fees default to 0.1%, paid in the purchasing asset

### Roadmap
- Private sales and OTC support via buyer whitelist
- Enforce minimum purchase amount
- Detailed accounting export

# dualSTAKE Overview

dualSTAKE is a **family of liquid staking tokens** on Algorand that **convert staking rewards** into ASAs.

Each dualSTAKE token pairs `ALGO` and an ASA into a liquid staking token:

- `coopALGO` = `ALGO` + `COOP`
- `oraALGO` = `ALGO` + `ORA`
- `cosgALGO` = `ALGO` + `COSG`

In a nutshell:

1) dualSTAKE smart contracts **participate in consensus**.
2) Staking rewards are **swapped** into the paired ASA.
3) Through these swaps, dualSTAKE tokens **appreciate against the ASA**.

Benefits for users:
- Stake `ALGO`, get rewarded in your ASA of choice
  - Steady stream of DCA-like buys

Benefits for ASA creators:
- Leverage community `ALGO` into a steady stream of buying pressure for the ASA
- Provide utility for the ASA via the dualSTAKE token soft-lock

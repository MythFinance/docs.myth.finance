# Farm provision

Ecosystem projects and ASA creators are encouraged to create farms for their dualSTAKE tokens.

Farms are configured to pay out a specific supplement in ASA along with each staking reward disbursed by the Algorand protocol.

This extra farming incentive should further incentivize users to deposit their ALGO along with the paired ASA into the community's dualSTAKE token. More ALGO deposited means more blocks produced, means more frequent buying pressure on the token.

As rewards accumulate and are swapped, the exchange rate of the dualSTAKE token to the ASA increases globally for all holders, current and future.

Minting new dualSTAKE tokens will require more of the ASA as time moves on, which provides a soft-lock utility for tokens making use of this system.

## Farming benefits

1) buying pressure, resulting from swapping rewards
2) utilizing part of their circulating supply into the dualSTAKE system as a soft-lock

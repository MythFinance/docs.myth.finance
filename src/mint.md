# Minting

Users can mint dualSTAKE tokens by depositing `ALGO` and the paired ASA into the smart contract.

Using `oraALGO` as an example, a user would mint by depositing:

- `ALGO` at a fixed 1:1 rate
- `ORA` at the current [exchange rate](./rate.html).

In exchange, they receive an equal amount of `oraALGO` tokens to the `ALGO` they deposited.

_E.g. If `oraALGO` is at 10:1 with `ORA`, the user would deposit 10 `ALGO` + 1 `ORA` to receive 10 `oraALGO` tokens._

_If `oraALGO` is at 2:1 with `ORA`, the user would deposit 10 `ALGO` + 5 `ORA` to receive 10 `oraALGO` tokens._

Minting does not incur any platform fees.

# dualSTAKE Overview

> dualSTAKE is a **family of liquid staking tokens** on Algorand that **convert staking rewards** into ASAs.

Each dualSTAKE token pairs `ALGO` and an ASA into a liquid staking token:

- `gobtcALGO` dualSTAKE = `ALGO` + `goBTC`
- `coopALGO` dualSTAKE = `ALGO` + `COOP`
- `cosgALGO` dualSTAKE = `ALGO` + `COSG`
- etc

> dualSTAKE tokens are always at 1:1 rate with `ALGO`, and accrue rewards in the form of an increasing exchange rate with the paired ASA.

In a nutshell:

1) Users **stake** `ALGO` + a paired ASA, receiving dualSTAKE tokens.
2) dualSTAKE smart contracts **participate in consensus**.
3) Consensus staking rewards are **automatically swapped** from `ALGO` into the paired ASA.
4) Users later **redeem** dualSTAKE tokens for 1:1 ALGO, plus more of the paired ASA.

dualSTAKE works best when further incentivized through [dualSTAKE farms](./farming.html)

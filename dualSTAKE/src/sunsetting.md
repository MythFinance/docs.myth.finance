# Sunsetting dualSTAKE tokens

> dualSTAKE tokens that **fall below 30,000 ALGO balance** for a prolonged period of time may become **sunset**.

This feature enables Myth Finance to "clean up" dualSTAKE tokens that have no traction, while letting holders redeem their deposited ALGO.

Sunsetting criteria:

- dualSTAKE token remains under rewards eligibility balance (30,000 ALGO) for the majority of a consecutive 4 week period.

Sunsetting a dualSTAKE token:

- disables any further minting of the dualSTAKE.
- hides the token from the main dualSTAKE listings page.

**Users will be able to redeem their dualSTAKE tokens for as long as there are any in circulation.**

- in the **Sunsetting** section at the bottom of the [dualSTAKE listings](https://myth.finance/dualSTAKE) page, or
- visiting their page directly, e.g. https://myth.finance/dualSTAKE/xyzALGO, or
- visiting their asset URL, e.g. https://myth.finance/asset/1234

# Farm provision

> _dualSTAKE farms offer your users a higher overall APR in return for choosing to stake on your dualSTAKE token over other appealing liquid staking options in the ecosystem._

dualSTAKE farms can be configured to pay out an extra amount of the paired ASA for each block produced by dualSTAKE contracts.

Farms are permissionless, immutable and extendable:

- anyone can set them up
- once set up, farms can not be cancelled
- anyone can extend an existing farm by contributing more ASA

Farms complete the synergy between your ASA and its dualSTAKE form. Read about the benefits of providing farms below.

_Note: Farms only support the paired ASA of each dualSTAKE contract, e.g. `coopALGO` farms can only supplement with `COOP`._

## Farming benefits

**As an ASA creator or community, dualSTAKE farms allow you to utilize your ASA treasury into a buying pressure incentive.**

1) increase the APR of your dualSTAKE token, making it more competitive.
2) more ALGO locked âž¡ stronger buying pressure.
3) provide additional soft-lock utility to your ASA via dualSTAKE

Offering a higher APR compared to competing staking options will incentivize your users to stake their `ALGO` on your community's dualSTAKE token. More `ALGO` staked means more blocks produced, which results in more frequent swaps, producing stronger buying pressure on your ASA.

As rewards accumulate and are swapped, the exchange rate of the dualSTAKE token to the ASA increases globally for all holders, current and future. As a secondary benefit, minting new dualSTAKE tokens will require more of the ASA as time moves on, which provides a **soft-lock utility for tokens making use of this system.**

# dualSTAKE Overview

> dualSTAKE is a **family of liquid staking tokens** on Algorand that **convert staking rewards** into ASAs.

Each dualSTAKE token pairs `ALGO` and an ASA into a liquid staking token:

- `gobtcALGO` = `ALGO` + `goBTC`
- `coopALGO` = `ALGO` + `COOP`

In a nutshell:

1) Users **stake** `ALGO` + a paired ASA, receiving dualSTAKE tokens
2) dualSTAKE smart contracts **participate in consensus**.
3) ALGO staking rewards are **swapped** into the paired ASA.
4) Users **redeem** dualSTAKE tokens for 1:1 ALGO, plus rewards in paired ASA form.

Benefits for users:
- Stake `ALGO`, get rewarded in your ASA of choice
  - Steady stream of DCA-like buys

Benefits for ASA creators:
- Leverage community `ALGO` into a steady stream of buying pressure for your ASA
- Provide utility for the ASA via the implicit dualSTAKE token soft-lock

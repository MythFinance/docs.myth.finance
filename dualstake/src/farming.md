# Farm provision

> _dualSTAKE farms offer your users a higher overall APR in return for choosing to stake on your dualSTAKE token over other appealing liquid staking options in the ecosystem._

Farms are configured to pay out an extra ASA amount for each block produced by dualSTAKE contracts.

**As an ASA creator or community, dualSTAKE farms allow you to utilize your ASA treasury into a buying pressure incentive.**

Offering a higher APR compared to vanilla liquid staking offerings incentivizes users to stake their `ALGO` along with the paired ASA into your community's dualSTAKE token. More `ALGO` deposited means more blocks produced, which in turn produces more buying pressure on your ASA.

As rewards accumulate and are swapped, the exchange rate of the dualSTAKE token to the ASA increases globally for all holders, current and future.

As a secondary benefit, minting new dualSTAKE tokens will require more of the ASA as time moves on, which provides a **soft-lock utility for tokens making use of this system.**

- Farms can only pay out in the paired ASA
- Farms are permissionless. Anyone can set up a farm, or extend an existing farm.

## Farming benefits

1) increase the APR of your dualSTAKE token, making it more competitive
2) more ALGO locked âž¡ more buying pressure, resulting from swapping rewards
3) utilize part of your circulating supply as a soft-lock into the dualSTAKE system
